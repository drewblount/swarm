swarm
=====

a cybernetic, geodesic, interactive swarm


swarm is an interactive installation art project for Reed's Renn Fayre 2k14. Using Craig Reynold's boid's algorithm, we simulate a giant emergent swarm, which through the use of Xbox Kinects, interacts with its audience. Unlike many implementations of boids, we do not animate each individual in the flock, but rather we draw lines between each boid and its neighbors. This produces a great undulating net, the wire-frame of a cybernetic cloud. The swarm is the entity, the parts are invisible.
