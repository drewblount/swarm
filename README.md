swarm
=====

a cybernetic, geodesic, interactive swarm


swarm is an interactive installation art project for Reed's Renn Fayre 2k14. Using Craig Reynold's boids algorithm, I simulate a giant emergent swarm, projected onto a hanging screen. swarm interacts with its audience, seeing them with an Xbox Kinect. Unlike many implementations of boids, I do not animate each individual in the flock, but rather draw lines between each boid and its neighbors. This produces a great undulating net, the wire-frame of a cybernetic cloud. The swarm is real, the parts disappear.
